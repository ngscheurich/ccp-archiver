The CCP Archiver is a tool I built to extract all of the content from [The Advocate](http://theadvocate.com)â€™s CMS, store it in a safe place, and transform it to meet the import requirements of a new CMS.

## Getting Started

with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with [this script].
